In The Name Of ALLAH
 Overview of Calculator project:
 
 In this project I'm going to make a scientific (engineering) calculator on CMD with python.

 So the project is inprogress and   in the future I'll add more  feature .

 Calculator version  1.1 :
 this calculator like the regular calculators in the store can calculate 4 main functions (+ , - , ร , รท ) and  another one is Sqrt functions.

Calculator version 2.0 :

& THIS !.
 this is contains the version one features with other feature wich is The MTT test fraction calculator.
 now you think about it, why I added this feature to it?
	the answer is just one sentence : It's Necessary ! XD
 because some times we can make some mistakes in our calculations ; so this program helps to don't make any mistake ! and if you make
 mistake you will agree why it happend .
 and other main feature is round , with this  function you can give the number of decymal places to the program and take short answer.
